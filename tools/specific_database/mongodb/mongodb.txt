Mongodb 
Document-oriented (JSON/BSON)	
Collections of documents
Schema-less (dynamic documents)	
MongoDB Query Language (MQL)		
Rich and expressive query syntax	
Architecture
    => Master-Slave (Replica Sets)	
Fault Tolerance
    => Replica sets and sharding	
CAP Theoram
    => CP (Consistency and Partition tolerance)	
Consistency
    => Strong consistency by default	
Read Write 
    => Balanced read-write workloads	
Use 
    => Your workload is read-heavy or balanced

When to use 
1. Schema Flexibility
    => Your data model evolves frequently (e.g., startups, prototyping).
    => Different documents in a collection can have different fields.
2. Document-Oriented Data
    => Your data fits naturally as JSON-like documents (BSON).
    => You need to store nested objects, arrays, and hierarchical structures.
3. High Write Throughput & Performance
    => You need high write speed with horizontal scaling.
    => You prefer eventual consistency over strict ACID guarantees.
4. Horizontal Scalability
    => You expect big data volumes and want to scale easily.
    => You want automatic sharding to distribute data across nodes.

When Not to Use MongoDB
ou need multi-row ACID transactions across collections.
You rely on complex joins and relational integrity.
You’re doing heavy aggregations over massive structured datasets (better suited to SQL or columnar stores).
You need real-time analytics (consider Apache Druid, ClickHouse, or BigQuery instead).
