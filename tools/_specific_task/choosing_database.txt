Choice of Database 
    => Not impact functional requirement
    => It impacts non functional requirement mainly

1. Caching Solutions
    => Generally key value pair we have 
        => Redis
        => Memcached
        => Hazelcast

2. File Storage
    => To Store Image Video
    => Blob Storage 
        => Amazon S3 
        => CDN
            => Distributing same images 
        
3. Searching Capabilities
    => With support of fuzzy search 
    => Text search Engine 
        => Elastic Search Engine 
            => It is a document database 
        => Solar
            => It is a document database 
    => Data could be lost 
    => Not very much as database
    => Store data in someone else primary search of truth
    => Mainly a search Engine

4. Time Series Database (Time series data like logs metrics of application)
    => Extension of relational databases
    => Not all functionality of sql 
    => But some additional functionality 
    => Regular Database 
        => Update a record 
        => Query random record 
    => Sequential update 
    => Append only data 
    => No random read and update
    => Query on time range
    => Time Series Database 
        => InfluxDB 
        => OpenTsDB

5. Analytics on large database
    => Datawarehouse 
    => Not transactional system 
    => Offline
    => Databases
        => Hadoop

For SQL & NoSQL
Factors Affecting choice of database
1. Structure of Data 
    => Structured Information 
        => Easily model in some form a table 
        => ACID Properties Required 
            => Payment System 
            => Inventory Management System 
            => Atomicity, Consistency 
            => MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server
        => ACID Properties Not Required 
            => Any database would be fine
    => Non structured Database
        => Data 1
            => Large set of attributed
            => Varierty of Queries
            => Document Databases
                => MongoDB, CouchBase
        => Data 2
            => Ever increasing data 
            => Finite Queries 
            => Columnar DB 
                => Cassandra DB 
                => HBase
