🔶 Start with learning system design basics from Gaurav Sen's playlist https://lnkd.in/gJTvNSct

🔶One of the most useful resources for HLD preparation is “System Design Interview” by Alex Xu. I highly recommend reading this book thoroughly as all the system design problems in this book are structured the way an interviewer expects you to answer 👩‍💻

🔶 Once you are familiar with the basic system design problems given in the above book, you can study additional design problems from Narendra Lakshmana Gowda’s system design playlist
