They ask me create a system where we manage the inventory and warehouses
We can transfer items from one warehouse to other warehouse
We will populate the inventory in warehouse by some kind of excel file , in excel file we have all the item and quantity required information.
We need to think about how we can track the mismatch inventory and lost item
How we will manage the transfer of data from one warehouse to another ( I give approach by creating order and maintain status as it physical transfer , interviewer said don't think it as a physical transfer , just think to make the server call and update it in persistent database)
Interviewer expectation is quite different , they want me to treat each item as unique and with the unique sequence number we have to manage it , they don't want me to take quantity in picture. I messed up this round and rejected as more time spent on DB design and API designing because of bit confusion and I left with very less time for HLD design .**
