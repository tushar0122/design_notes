It looks like you meant HTTP vs WebSocket. Hereâ€™s a comparison of the two:

1. Protocol Type
    => HTTP: A request-response protocol. The client requests data, and the server responds once per request.
    => WebSocket: A full-duplex communication protocol that allows continuous two-way communication between client and server.
2. Connection Behavior
    => HTTP: A new connection is established for each request and closed after the response is received.
    => WebSocket: A persistent connection is maintained between the client and server after the initial handshake.
3. Latency & Efficiency
    => HTTP: Higher latency due to repeated handshakes and request overhead.
    => WebSocket: Lower latency as data can be pushed from the server without repeated handshakes.
4. Use Cases
    => HTTP: Suitable for REST APIs, web pages, file downloads, and applications where real-time communication is not essential.
    => WebSocket: Ideal for chat applications, live notifications, multiplayer games, and stock market updates.
5. Data Format
    => HTTP: Typically uses JSON or XML in REST APIs, with each request carrying full headers.
    => WebSocket: Supports binary and text frames with minimal overhead.
6. Server Push Support
    => HTTP: Not built-in (requires workarounds like long polling or Server-Sent Events).
    => WebSocket: Natively supports real-time server push.
7. Security
HTTP: Uses HTTPS (TLS) for security.
WebSocket: Uses wss:// (WebSocket Secure) for encryption.
