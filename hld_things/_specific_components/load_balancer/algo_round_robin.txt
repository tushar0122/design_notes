Round Robin 
    => Round Robin is a simple, classic load balancing algorithm where incoming requests are distributed sequentially across a pool of backend servers. It’s like taking turns — server A, then B, then C, then back to A.

Weighted Round Robin
    => Assigns a weight to each server.
    => More powerful servers get more requests.
    => E.g., Server A (weight 2), Server B (weight 1):
    → A, A, B, A, A, B...

Dynamic Round Robin
    => Adjusts weights in real-time based on performance or health metrics.
