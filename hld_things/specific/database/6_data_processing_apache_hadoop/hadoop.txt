Apache Hadoop is an open-source framework for storing and processing massive amounts of data distributed across clusters of commodity hardware.
It’s designed for Big Data workloads that are too big or complex for traditional databases.

When to Use Hadoop
1. You Have Massive Volumes of Data (Big Data)
When data size is too large for traditional databases (terabytes to petabytes).
Examples: logs, social media feeds, sensor data, clickstream data.

2. You Need Distributed Storage and Processing
When data must be distributed across many servers for storage and parallel processing.
Hadoop’s HDFS + MapReduce/YARN lets you store/process data on commodity hardware clusters.

3. Batch Processing and ETL Jobs
When you need to run complex batch jobs like aggregations, filtering, sorting.
Ideal for offline analytics, reporting, and data transformation pipelines.

4. Cost-Effective Storage
When you want to store large amounts of data cheaply using commodity hardware instead of expensive SAN/NAS.
Hadoop handles failures gracefully with data replication.

5. You Work with Diverse Data Types
Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data — Hadoop can handle all.
No need to predefine schema strictly (schema-on-read).

6. You Need Scalability & Fault Tolerance
Systems that must scale out easily by adding nodes.
High availability is important — node failures happen but processing continues.

7. You Use Data Warehousing / Analytics at Scale
When running SQL-like queries on huge datasets (via Hive, Impala).
When integrating with tools like Spark for faster analytics.

When Hadoop May Not Be Ideal
For low-latency or real-time processing — Hadoop’s MapReduce is batch-oriented and relatively slow.
For small datasets or simple OLTP (transactional) workloads.
When you need strong transactional consistency like relational DBs.
