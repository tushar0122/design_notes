Cassandra
    => Data Structure 
        => Tables, rows, Partitions, Clustering keys 
    => Schema
        => Wide-column store (table-like with flexible columns)
        => Semi structured
        => Schema required for tables
        => Primary Key = Partitioning Key + Clustering Key
        => Column Addition doesn't require schema change, directly insert new column
        => Each row can have different set of columns 
    => Querying 
        => No Joins 
    => Usecase 
        => Not for complex joins
