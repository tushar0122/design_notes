Cassandra
    => Schema
        => Wide-column store (table-like with flexible columns)
        => Semi structured
        => Schema required for tables
        => Primary Key = Partitioning Key + Clustering Key
        => Column Addition doesn't require schema change, directly insert new column
        => Each row can have different set of columns 
    => Querying 
        => No Joins 
    => Usecase 
        => Not for complex joins

=> Data Structure 
    => Tables, rows, Partitions, Clustering keys 
 
=> Focus 
    => High availability, fast writes, scalability
=> Design Approach
    => Query-first, denormalized

Self Managed
    => Scalability
        => Horizontally Scalable
    => Architecture
        => Masterless (Peer-to-Peer)
