SQL
    => Focus 
        => Data Integrity, Relations
    => Design Approach
        => Data normalization	
    => Schema 
        => Strict schema (all rows follow same structure)	
        => Tables with rows and fixed columns	
        => Highly normalized data	
    => Query 
        Supports joins and foreign keys	
    => Transaction
        => Strong consistency (ACID compliant)	
    => Performance
        => Read Performance
            => Fast with proper indexing	
        => Write Performance	
            => Moderate (depends on indexing, constraints)
    => Usecase
        => Complex query, joins, integrity
        => Structured schema, joins, ACID Transaction
        => Not Good For Horizontal Scaling

Self Managed
    => Scalability
        => Vertical Scaling
        => Limited Horizontal Scaling
    => Replication
        Master-slave or single-node	
        Update in-place	
        Data Distribution
            => Application-level or middleware-driven
